# Security Guidelines

## üîí MongoDB Atlas Security Best Practices

### 1. **Immediate Actions Required**
If you received a security alert about MongoDB credentials:

1. **Rotate the secret immediately**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
   - Navigate to Database Access
   - Delete the compromised user
   - Create a new user with strong password

2. **Revoke database access**
   - Check Network Access settings
   - Remove any unauthorized IP addresses
   - Enable IP whitelist for your application servers only

3. **Check security logs**
   - Review MongoDB Atlas security logs
   - Look for unusual access patterns
   - Monitor for unauthorized queries

4. **Update connection strings**
   - Update all applications with new credentials
   - Test connections thoroughly
   - Remove old credentials from all environments

### 2. **Environment Variables Security**

#### ‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Create `.env` files locally (never commit to Git)
- Use different credentials for development/production
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords

#### ‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Never share credentials in chat/email
- Never use default passwords
- Never use the same credentials across environments

### 3. **MongoDB Atlas Configuration**

#### **Database User Settings:**
```
Username: app_user_production
Password: [Strong password with special characters]
Database User Privileges: Read and write to any database
```

#### **Network Access:**
```
IP Whitelist: 
- Your application server IPs only
- Your development machine IP
- Remove 0.0.0.0/0 (allows access from anywhere)
```

#### **Security Features:**
- Enable MongoDB Atlas authentication
- Enable encryption at rest
- Enable encryption in transit
- Enable audit logs
- Enable real-time performance monitoring

### 4. **Code Security**

#### **Environment Variables:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good - Use environment variables
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI;

// ‚ùå Bad - Hardcoded credentials
const MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/db';
```

#### **Git Ignore:**
```gitignore
# Security files
.env
.env.local
.env.production
backend/.env
*.key
*.pem
```

### 5. **Deployment Security**

#### **Production Environment:**
- Use environment variables in deployment platform
- Enable HTTPS only
- Use secure headers (helmet.js)
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity

#### **Development Environment:**
- Use local MongoDB or separate Atlas cluster
- Never use production credentials in development
- Use different database names for each environment

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerts**

#### **Set up alerts for:**
- Unusual database access patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Large data transfers
- Unauthorized IP access
- Performance anomalies

### 7. **Incident Response**

If credentials are compromised:

1. **Immediate Response (0-1 hour):**
   - Rotate all affected credentials
   - Revoke access for compromised accounts
   - Check logs for unauthorized access

2. **Short-term Response (1-24 hours):**
   - Update all applications with new credentials
   - Review and strengthen security measures
   - Notify team members

3. **Long-term Response (1-7 days):**
   - Conduct security audit
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Update security policies
   - Train team on security best practices
